# Salesforce Extension Plus

The extension provides some tools to enhance the Salesforce development experience in Visual Studio Code. It is a collection of useful features that can help developers work more efficiently with Salesforce projects and that are not included in the official Salesforce Extension pack.

## Features

### Use labels from your custom label files

Autocomplete is enabled for labels in Apex (`.cls`) files. Whenever you type `Label.` you'll see a list of labels available according to the custom label metadata files in your project's directory.

This feature is useful for developers who want to quickly access and use custom labels in their Apex code without having to manually type out the label names.
